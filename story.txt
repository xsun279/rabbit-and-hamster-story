The rabbit Ruby and the hamster Hadley are each other's best frinds. 

One night, Ruby and Hadley sit next to each other around a small table enjoying the beautiful stars. 

"Guess how much I like you?" Asked the little hamster.

Ruby hesitates and says: "Oh, I really have no idea". 

"I like you such much." Little Hadley opens his arms so wide that he could not open them again.

The little rabbit is going to bed. He holds the big rabbits long ears tightly and wants the big rabbit to listen to him.

"Guess how much I love you", ASked the little rabbit.

"Oh! I can't guess!. " Big rabbit said with a smile.

"I love you so much." The little rabbit opened his arms and says, "but I love you so much!".

The Big rabbit waddled towards the little rabbit and hugged tightly. The two were very happy that they had each other. They promised each other to always be best friends. Ruby asked Hadley, "Do you want to go to the party tomorrow with me?" 

"Sure" responded Ruby with gleeful cheer. "But why me?" She asks, raising her ear. 

"Because you're my best friend" Replied the hamster, "And I like you alot"
