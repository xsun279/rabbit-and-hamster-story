The rabbit Ruby and the hamster Hadley are each other's best frinds. 

One night, Ruby and Hadley sit next to each other around a small table enjoying the beautiful stars. 

"Guess how much I like you?" Asked the little hamster.

Ruby hesitates and says: "Oh, I really have no idea". 

"I like you such much." Little Hadley opens his arms so wide that he could not open them again.

The little rabbit is going to bed. He holds the big rabbits long ears tightly and wants the big rabbit to listen to him.

"Guess how much I love you", ASked the little rabbit.

"Oh! I can't guess!. " Big rabbit said with a smile.

"I love you so much." The little rabbit opened his arms and says, "but I love you so much!".
