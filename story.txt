The rabbit Ruby and the hamster Hadley are each other's best frinds. 

One night, Ruby and Hadley sit next to each other around a small table enjoying the beautiful stars. 

"Guess how much I like you?" Asked the little hamster.

Ruby hesitates and says: "Oh, I really have no idea". 

"I like you such much." Little Hadley opens his arms so wide that he could not open them again.
